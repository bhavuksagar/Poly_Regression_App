<H1>Polynomial Regression</H1>
<p>Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent(y) and independent variable(x) as nth degree polynomial. The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:

y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n

It is also called the special case of Multiple Linear Regression in ML. Because we add some polynomial terms to the Multiple Linear regression equation to convert it into Polynomial Regression. It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy. The dataset used in Polynomial regression for training is of non-linear nature. It makes use of a 
linear regression model to fit the complicated and non-linear functions and datasets.</p>
